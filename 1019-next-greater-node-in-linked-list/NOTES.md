- first convert the linkedlist into arraylist
- now create a stack which will be holding indices
- run a loop over arraylist
- if stack is not empty and the top element of stack is less then the current element
- keep on popping the top element from stack and write the current value at that popped index
- in the end push the current element index in the stack
