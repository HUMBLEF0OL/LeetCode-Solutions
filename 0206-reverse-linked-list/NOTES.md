Reverse Linked List using recursion
â€‹
* laydown the base condition
* the recursive function will return the new updated head
* create a node that will point to the next node of current head and make its next as head i.e making a new link from head.next to head (in reverse order)
* now break the existing the pointer from head to head.next
* in the end return the new head that we received from the recursive function.
