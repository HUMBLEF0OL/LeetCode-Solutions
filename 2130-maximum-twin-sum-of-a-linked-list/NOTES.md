There are multiple methods of solving this problem and one such method is by reversing the second half of the list and then maintaining the twinSum result. Here is the breakdown of steps:
* Using slow and fast pointer technique find the mid point of the list
* Now break the list into 2 halves based on mid point of list
* Reverse the second half of the list
* Now run a loop over both of the list and maintain the maximum twinSum variable
